This project was done within the scope of the Project/Internship Curricular Unit (PESTA) of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Degree (LEEC) of the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP).

The Electrical Engineering Department receives several proposals for internships from several companies, being necessary that the degree director responsible for the Project/Internship curricular unit manages them.

Moreover, each teacher of the Electrical Engineering Department makes several proposals of projects to students, being necessary a management by the teachers regarding the allocation of a student to each of their proposals.

This project aims to develop a platform where it will be possible for companies to send their internship proposals, for students to apply for an internship or project proposal, for teachers to manage their project proposals and the internships they lead, and for degree directors to manage the internship proposals of their degree, as well as access all the information about the project proposals.

The platform was developed using PHP technology for the back-end and React technology for the front-end.
